            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student at Brigham Young University seeking a degree in Information Systems. I always
                have had a passion for problem-solving and
                creating new ways to overcome obstacles. Throughout my education, this love for problem-solving has
                transferred to my love for coding, learning new programming languages, and exploring a career in
                Information Systems. Developing skills like
                critical thinking has been fulfilling in my education thus far, and I look forward to continuing to
                expand my abilities.
                <br><br>
                The purpose of this website is to showcase some of the skills that I have developed and display
                projects that I have created. This website has been created by me from scratch using HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. Please feel free to look at my portfolio and learn more about me!
            </p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>I belong to a family of five. I have a twin sister Claire, and a younger sister Sophie, both of whom
                    also are students at BYU. I have
                    lived in Heber City, UT for the majority of my life, growing up loving the outdoors. I love to
                    travel with my family and spend time with them when I'm not busy with school.

            <div class="content">
                <p>One of my favorite hobbies is playing the bagpipes. Beginning with my grandma immigrating to the
                    United States from Scotland and starting a family of her own in Utah, I am proud of my Scottish
                    heritage. Starting at 11 years old, I learned how to play the bagpipes from my dad. We both are
                    currently members of the Salt Lake Scots Pipe Band, serving others in the community with our musical
                    abilities. I have entered multiple competitions in Utah, both competing solo and with the band. I
                    love continuing to grow my talents and look forward to further developing this skill.</p>

                </div>
                <p>During the winter I love to snow ski with my family. For the majority of my life my family has made
                    trips almost weekly every winter to Park City to go skiing. I love spending time in the mountains,
                    especially with my family.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>For two years I had the opportunity to serve a full-time proselyting mission for The Church of Jesus
                    Christ of Latter-day Saints in the greater St. Louis, MO area. This experience changed my life and
                    taught me the importance of charity and kindness. My service not only helped others overcome
                    struggles in their personal lives, but it also helped me change the way I view and treat other
                    people.</p>
